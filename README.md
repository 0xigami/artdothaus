<br/>
ART HAUS is an artist residency for the metaverse where NFT collectors can become keyholders and unlock privileged access to members-only exclusives. 

Our team is a collective of insanely passionate collectors, creators, and developers. But most importantly, we are curators.

What we do
We operate in unison with our curation protocol through which our process for artist discovery is augmented by AI-driven recommendations.

Despite our experimental nature as technologists, we understand the importance of connection, and are committed to a bespoke offering with a personal touch.

For artists
NFTs are a specialised field where we can lend our technical expertise and we are dedicated to helping artists realise the full potential of non-fungible tokens.

Attract investors and serious collectors with our in-depth research and showcasing.
Take part in our Artist Residency program and  the “Artists in Residence” podcast.
Premiere forthcoming works and hold exclusive private auctions with keyholders.
Apply for residency and experience creative sovereignty with your own custom smart contracts.

For collectors
Exploring NFT utility is something we have been experimenting with for some time and we are committed to collectors experiencing full utilisation of non-fungible tokens.

Unlock privileged access to members-only private content and exclusive auctions.
Make reservations to purchase early editions of our in-haus project collections.
Join our curatorship program and be rewarded with referral commissions. 
And a growing list of forthcoming benefits (stay tuned).
Become a  keyholder to unlock members-only exclusives, privileged access awaits.

Sincerely,

Head of HAUS
